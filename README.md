## Motivation

Although I don't need to know everything that is underneath my solution, I want to know which pieces are used where and why. To achieve that, there is no better way than assembling this whole template myself.

## Features

1.  [React + Typescript](#react--typescript)
2.  [Webpack](#webpack)
    1.  @aliases
    2.  Source maps
        1. Only for development and not for libs
    3.  Inline SVGs
    4.  Pollyfills
    5.  Favicon for dev and PRD
    6.  Bundling optimization:
        1. Bigger libs in isolated webpack bundle
        2. PRD bundle caching
        3. Pollyfills loaded only when necessary
3.  [Webpack dev server + Hot reload](#webpack-dev-server--hot-reload)
    1. Skipping some loaders for development build
    2. Support for SPA routing
4.  [Sass](#sass)
    1.  Typings for styles
5.  [Linters + Formatter](#linters--formatter)
    1. Stylelint
    2. Prettier integrated with ESLint

## React + Typescript

I believe typescript isn't just useful. It is essential.
Typings not only prevent unintentionally breaking an application but also help speed up development with tools like intellisense and [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/).

## Webpack

Webpack's documentation is quite huge and sometimes it is hard to find exactly which key or parameter is missing in order to achieve something. However, it is immensly popular and powerful so it is the way to go.

Plugins and loaders are isolated in their own methods. In case we want to create a separate webpack build for part of this solution in the future, probably we still want to use the same loaders for the same types of files, so isolating these configurations might be helpful.

Regarding code bundling, there are a few optimizations I wanted done out of the box:

**Bundle separation and caching**

Out of the box, webpack does a pretty good job here.
Bundles are generated using `[contentHash]` for PRD and there is a single entry point with a loader.
Common dependencies are isolated in their own bundle to avoid downloading the same thing twice.
For this application, I am including all node modules in the vendors bundle, but as an application grows, it makes sense to split these into smaller bundles, grouped by _changing frequency_. If we update one package, we doÂ´t want the user to download all our other big dependencies again.

Regarding minimization, `webpack@5` is shipped with `terser-webpack-plugin` configured out of the box to minimize the output of the bundles in production mode.

**Polyffils**

Polyfills are necessary for _some_ users but just unnecessary boilerplate for **most**.
Perfect solution? [This](https://medium.com/hackernoon/polyfills-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-or-maybe-a-bit-less-7c8de164e423) puts it out in an easy to read and yet understandable way. [Webpack-polyfill-injector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-polyfill-injector) does exactly what we want.
We should just take into consideration that due to the validation script done on page load, our entry point bundle will also change if we add and or remove some polyfill.

I included what will most likely be used in my application. Adjust to your own needs.

-   _Note_: `webpack-polyfill-injector` hasn't been updated for two years now. It still has plenty of downloads and everything seems to work, but there are a couple of issues with webpack@5. It is worth finding a still maintained alternative, or changing to the more static `@babel/preset-env`'s `useBuiltIns`.

## Webpack dev server + Hot reload

Not having to build your whole application after every change, no matter how small it is, is now a standard in every solution, so there isn't much to elaborate here. Using the most (although _experimental_) up to date solution with [react-refresh](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin).

**Skipping some plugins and loaders for development build**

When developing a first draft for some component, I don't want to be forced to define types for everything because I know I am still changing them all the time. It is nice that my editor keeps telling me it is wrong and I can't forget about it, but it isn't nice that my application won't build and let me see this first draft in the browser. Therefore, `tsc` will only be ran for builds, not for the `devServer`.

To help speed up development even more, `eslint-loader` and `styleLintPlugin` are only enabled for PRD build.

**Plugins and loaders used only for development**

1. `@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin` & `react-refresh`
    - Only used for **HOT** development. It is not needed for bundle building and if used, throws a "TypeError (...) data is not defined" exception.
2. `webpack.WatchIgnorePlugin`
    - Ignores the specified pattern in watch mode, as in, ignores type files for hot reload to create unnecessary reloads.
3. `webpack.SourceMapDevToolPlugin`
    - Equivalent of using `devtool: option`, but with more configurations available.
4. `webpack-bundle-analyzer`
    - Creates a visual representation of generated bundles and their sizes.
    - `webpack-bundle-analyzer` will not provide a complete analysis on the files generated by `webpack-dev-server` because the devServer keeps the generated files only in RAM and does not write to the disk. To get the complete analysis, run the **build** in production mode.

## Sass

A css preprocessor is usefull and helps keeping the codebase organized.
Regarding the Less vs Sass battle, Less would surely be enough for mostly every functionality. However, as pointed out in this [article](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/) written by someone with apparently a much better preprocessor understanding than me, sass is more popular and overall better.

**Typings for styles**

.d.ts files are also created for .scss files.
Typings for css not only help speed up development but also provide a huge safety line when working with shared styles.

## Linters + Formatter

Regarding linters, TSLint is being deprecated in favor of ESLint and I am not aware of any real direct competition to stylelint, so these were obvious choices.
Regarding a formatter, I only used VSCode default formatter professionally. However, Prettier is pretty popular, has plenty of support and is easy to integrate with ESLint, which saves plenty of development time (automation is wonderful).

Prettier is integrated with esLint so that auto formatting a file will never collide with esLint rules. Also, when formatting a file, auto fixable problems should be automatically formatted.
